The EMCOPY.EXE tool provides an user the way to copy a file or a
directory and included subdirectories from and to a NTFS partition with
security intact.

The user account must grant the Backup and Restores privileges. It must
be also a member of administrators or account operators on both the
source and the destination computers.

Emcopy.exe copies and migrate the local user and group security entries. 
This tool does not copy the local user(s) and group(s) database from one
computer to another. You must prior use EMC utility LGDUP.EXE if you whish
to enable the "/lg" or the "/lu" option (local group or local user copy).

The "/nosec" option disables the copy of the NT security properties of
the file or the directory. By default, discretionary access control-lists
are replicated on the created file or directory. This option takes priority
on the "/o", "/a", "/lg", "/i" options.

The "/secfix" option enables to update of the NT security properties
even if the destination file or directory already exists. When destination
object exits, security from source is merged with security from destination.

The "/secforce" option enables to force update of the NT security properties
even if the destination file or directory already exists. When destination
object exists, security from source overwrite the destination security.

The "/o" option enables the copy of a file's owner. Without this option,
the account used for the copy will be the owner of the copied files and
directories.

The "/a" option enables the copy of auditing informations. The "Manage 
Auditing" privilege must also be granted by the user account.

The "/dac" option enables the copy of Dynamic Access Control (DAC) informations. 
The "Manage Auditing" privilege must also be granted by the user account.

The "/hda <account>" option enables the homedir migration mode. In that mode
security information is derived from the security information of the target
directory when it exists or from the security information of its parent
directory.

The "/lg" option enables the copy of local group security entries. Without
this option, local group entries are ignored.

The "/lu" option enables the copy of local user security entries. Without
this option, local user entries are ignored.

The "/i" option is useful to ignore security entries with local users.
By definition, local users are only unknown for the NT server or worktstation
where they are created. To avoid security replication error on the destination
server, it is possible to remove this type of user in the copied properties.

The "/create" creates 0 file length rather than copy the data.

The "/s" option enables the copy of the subdirectories.

The "/lev:n" sets the depth level of scanned directories.

The "/d" option provides to copy only source files which have the 
LAST MODIFICATION time greater than the existing target copy.

The "/de" option provides to copy the source file when its last modification time
is not equal to the destination file's modification time or when files size are
differents.

The /xjd option force emcopy to ignore directories that are mount point or DFS link. By
default emcopy considers these kinds of directory as regular directories.

The "/sd" option is to preserve the security. In this case, the file content
is not copied if any error occurred during the security setting.

The /sidmapfile <mapping_file> specifies a file that contains mapping records to be used 
for SID translation.

The /ignoredhsm option forces emcopy to remove any DHSM specific information and to remove
the OFFLINE attribute when present.

The "/l" option evaluates the number of files to copy without to do any file 
duplication. Compares also the NT security if the "/secfix or /secforce" option
security. In that case, the "/o" and "/a" switches are used to specify the owner
and the audit properties comparison. When differences occur, the properties of both
the source and destination files or directory are printed.

The "/c" switch allows the process to continue after the retries.

The "/z" switch is the restartable mode: the restartable mode is no more supported,
usage of this switch doesn't have any effect.

The "/r:n" option specifies the maximum number of retries. By default it is set up
to 100.

The "/w:n" option specifies the time in seconds to wait between two retries. 
By default it is set up to 30 seconds.

The "/th n" option specifies the maximum number of thread. By default it is set up
to 64.

The "/cm content" option enables a file content comparaison mode. Content of source
and target files are binary compared after the copy or when doing an evaluation of
the copy.

The "/cm md5" option enables a file content check after the copy using md5 signatures computed
on both source and target files.

The "/purge" option enables the deletion of the files and directories from
the destination tree which do not exist in the source one.

The "/preserveroot" option enables the preservation at the root directory , when purge is option is
set, of the files and directories from the destination tree which do not exist in the source one.

The "/compress ignore" option forces emcopy to ignore the compress attribute on files
and directories.

The "/compress forcefile" option forces emcopy to set the compressed attribute on files

The "/compress forcedir" option forces emcopy to set the compressed attribute on directories

The "/compress forceall" option forces emcopy to set the compressed attribute on files
and directories.

The "/sdd" option forces the target directory's dates to be synchronized
with the source directory's dates.

The "/stream" option enables the copie of files and directories datastreams.
Without that option only the main datastream of files are copied.

The "/log:filename" option allows to redirect the console messages to a new file.
The "/log+:filename" option appends the new messages to an existing file.
The "/u" option force logfile to be filled up with unicode character set.

The "/q" switch allows the user to disable the print of the files on stdout.

The "/f" switch allows the user to ask for the fullpath print, both the source and
the destination paths are printed. By default, only the source path is printed.

The "/BackupSD" and "/RestoreSD" switches allow to backup and restore the security
properties without copying the file content. There is no local group translation and
local SID suppression.

The "/nd:domain_name" switch allow to translate SD using new domain domain_name instead of 
original domain.

The "/preserverSIDh" switch allow to preserve SID from previous domain. By default emcopy 
replace obsolete SID by corresponding SID in current domain.

The "/nodf switch allow to only do a name filtering on file. By default directories and files
are processed only if they feet with the list of names that are specified in the command line.

The "/xd dir [dir ...] switch allow to excludes directories with the specified
names, paths, or wildcard characters

The "/xf file [file ...] switch allow to excludes files with the specified
names, paths, or wildcard characters


MODIFICATION HISTORY :
----------------------

01.00 :	Initial Release.

01.01 :	The summary is printed even after an CTRL-C from the user.
		The amount of copied bytes is printed in GB, MB, KB or Bytes according to
		the number of bytes.
		The /l options lists only the files to copy or the directories to create.

01.02 : Optimizations in
		- Setting the security descriptor by using NT_TRANSACT_CREATE SMB request.
		- If the parent dir of the target file or directory to copy did not exist
		  before the copy, the current target can not exist.
		- Getting file or directory info with findfirstfile() instead of getfileinfo.

02.00 : - New optional third argument which provides a list of selected files to copy.
            Wildcards are supported in these fields.
        
        - New options:
          /nosec
          /secfix
          /create
          /lev:n
          /c
          /z
          /r:n
          /w:n
          /log:filename /log+:filename
        
        - Exit code encoding.

02.01 : - Added EMC ACEs for backup.
        - Fixed issue: the restartable mode verifies if the source file has changed
                       between two retries. If changed, the copy is restarting from
                       the beginning.
        - Bug Fixed when a local group name is equal to the server name.
        - New SID cache implementation using Hash table.

02.02 : - Account names are NO case sensitive.
        - Fixed issue: when the source server is a Domain controller
                       - the lookup for Domain sid is now running.
                       - local user accounts can be duplicated because they 
                         are in a domain.

02.03 : - Added the /purge option.
        - Fixed issue in DACL comparison with Generic rights.
        - Fixed issue in Owner setting on a Security descriptor update
        - Fixed issue in SACL comparison and print.
        - The number of retry value is now defaulted to 100.

02.04 : - Fixed issue when there is a file sharing violation error from the source
          tree during the purge process. This caused a stop of the purge in the current
          directory.

02.04a: - Fixed issue about the comparison of the date. With the /d option, the creation date
          is now ignored and the data of the files are updated only if the last modification
          time of the source files is greater than the destination files.

02.04b: - Fixed issue about audit replication, the "Manage auditing and security log" privilege
          is checked when the /a (audit) switch is specified.

02.05 : - XCOPY interface implementation. When you rename EMCOPY.EXE to XCOPY.EXE, the
          tools proposes the same interface as XCOPY.EXE.
        - Added /q (quiet) and /f (fullpath) switches.

02.06 : - Added /nocase switch to create all files and directories in lower case characters.

02.07 : - Added two new switches /BackupSD and /RestoreSD to allow the backup and the 
          restore of the security descriptors without copy of file content.
        - Added note in usage about extended attributes duplication.
        - Builtin SID of owner are treated as other SIDs.
        - The purge process is following the depth level.

02.08 : - Take in account the prefixed local group name with the source server name,
          format <src_server_name>_<localgroup_name>.

02.09 :	- Change source and target tree scanning for performance enhancement.

02.10 :	- Check and set privilege are removed when running in xcopy mode. This allow a user
          without backup, restore and security privileges to perform a copy.
        - Add a fix for a problem when using the /purge switch
        - Add the /nd:domain_name switche that allow to translate ACE in domain
          domain_name rather than in original domain
        - Content of not empty files on the target side are no more cleared when doing
          a copy with the /create switch.

02.11 :	- Add the /preserveSIDh switche that allow to preserve previous SID instead of
          replacing them by corresponding SID in current valid domain.
        - Fix a problem when working in windows XP using UNC path.
        - Suppression of the path length limitation.

02.12 :	- Fix a problem when restoring SD when /RestoreSD switch is set.

02.13 :	- Fix a problem in the SID migration engine.

02.14 :	- Fix a performance issue when copying files with application of security
        - and without historical SID preservation.

02.15 :	- Fix an issue when copying offline file. Offline file size was
        - set to 0 after a copy.

02.16 : - Added /xd and /xf  switches to exclude specified files and
        - directories from the copy.

02.17 : - SID of Deleted account are now migrated as they are when setting the
          security information without preservation of historical SID. Lookup
          account name for deleted account are no more done.

02.18 : - Added the /lu switche to allow local user migration

02.19 : - Fixed issue when the target is a standalone server and when the /o
          option is set. In that case the default owner's sid is now the sid
          of the user connected to the target server. The default owner's sid is
          applied when the original owner's sid can not be migrated.

02.20 : - Fixed issue when the owner's SID of the source file can not be
          resolved and when target and source are the same machine. In That case
          the owner's sid of the target file was set to an unvalid SID.

        - Fixed issue when the group owner of a file is not set and when the /o
          switch is set. 

02.21 : - Fixed issue when the target or source resource is not connected when
          the tool is started.

02.22 : - Added the /stream option that allow the copie of files and directories
          datastream.

02.23 : - Changed the choice's strategy of the default primary group. This affect
          emcopy when the /o option is set. The default primary group is only needed
          when there is no way to migrate the original primary group of an object. In
          that case the "domain user" group will be applied to the primary group of
          the created object.

02.24 : - Fixed timestamp issue when a file to copy is marked as offline. In that case
          Creation date, Last access date and Modification date were not set to the
          original date.
          
02.25 : - Fixed file inconsistency issue when the source file is partially locked for
          read. In that case the content, the last access time and the last modification
          time of the target file were wrong.

02.26 : - Fixed issue when the source machine is a DC and security information
          migration is requested. In that case domain user or group were considered as
          local to the source machine. So emcopy tried to translate them as local to the
          target machine instead of migrating them as there are.

02.27 : - Fixed issue when a file when a name that will be used for 8.3 name already exists.
          Emcopy overwrote a file when the short name generated for a file matches the name
		  of a file in the same directory.		

02.28 : - Fixed issue when more than one file filter is specified in the command line. This 
          produced emcopy crash.
        - Fixed issue when there is no group on at least one file or directorie on the soure.
          This produced emcopy crash.
        - Total transferred size greater than 2 GB is now well printed out.

02.29 : - Fixed issue when a file to copy is marked as offline. In that case the created file
          on the target was never closed.
        - Fixed issue when the size of a file to copy is larger than 4Gb. In that case the file
          is copied but a wrong size mismatch error is detected. This causes emcopy to stop.

02.30 : - Nonexisting directory added in the middle of the target path is now supported.
          In that case the missing directory is created. The default inherited ACL is applied
          to the new directory.
        - Generalized the support of UNICODE string.
	    - Added the /u option that forces emcopy to write the log file using UNICODE character set.

02.31 : - Fixed regression issue that prevents emcopy to run on a NT4 system.
        - Added the display of the version of the system that host emcopy.
        - Added support of the special EMC ACE type 0xa9.
        
03.00 : - Added embedded manifest that allows to be run on a Vista system.

03.01 : - Fixed error when, in copy datastream mode, a directory with datastream is processed. In
          that case emcopy wasn't abble to process the directory and its content.

04.00 : - Changed working model from single threaded to multi threaded.
        - Added  new options : /th n, /de, /nodf, /sdd.

04.02 : - Removed restartable mode; /z option is still accepted without effect for backward comptability.
        - Enhanced transfert retry process.
        - Added suport of windows 6.x symbolic link.

04.03 : - Introduction of a 64 bits version of emcopy : emcopy64.
        - Memory usage enhancement.

04.04 : - Fixed issue when /xd is used in conjunction with /purge.
          In that case excluded directory could be removed from the target.

04.05 : - Added /xjd option that excludes windows Moint Point from the copy.  
        - Changed the way 8.3 files are treated. For each directory, 8.3 files are
          processed in single thread model before any others files.
        - Added new logging system that prevent mixed log messages.

04.06 : - Fixed issue when a directory symlink is purged. emcopy doesn't 
          follow anymore the link. The directory symlink is deleted.
        - Fixed issue when source tree can not be browsed and purge is active.
          The target tree is no more wrongly purged.
        - windows seven is now recognized
        - Added multi threaded model for the purge action.
        
04.07 : - Fixed issue when the name of a directory/file name on the source and target
          side are only case different and the purge mode is activated.

04.08 : - added /tee option that forces output to the console window as well as the logfile.
        - added /chunk option that allows emcopy to use the SMB2 copy chunk feature
        - Local groups, option /lg, and local users, option /lu, migration is now accepted
          when doing a backup SD, option /backupSD, or when doing a restore SD, option /restoreSD.
        - Fixed an issue when a huge count of log messages must be displayed. This sometimes
          leads emcopy to crash when closing.

04.09 : - Added local user compatibility mode for NTAP filer. The /lu option doesn't lead anymore
          emcopy to detect an irrecoverable error when the source is a NATP filer.
        - Fixed crash when formatting an error message related to an object that includes
          some specials characters in its name.

04.10 : - added the /secforce option that force emcopy to overwrite, instead of merge, security
          information when destination object already exists.

04.11 : - Added workaround for system that report TEMPORARY attribute for directory. This attribute
          is no more applied on the target side.
        - Fixed remaining cause of crash when formatting an error message related to an object that
          includes some specials characters in its name.
        - Changed the exclude options, /xd and /xf, behaviors. Exclude directives are now applied
          on both source and target side. When purge is enabled and an object is in one of the
          exclude lists, dir of file, it is no more purged from the target when it doesn't exist on
          the source side. This is applied only when the mother directory is not itself purged.

04.12 : - Added detection of DFS link. DFS links are excluded from the copy when option /xjd is set.
          Without option /xjd DFS link are considered as regular directory.

04.12B: - Added detection of wrong source local SID. When asking for local SID some old system response
          with the SID of the joined domain instead of its own local SID. This was the cause of some SID
          translations mismatch.
        - Added new option /localsidsource <SIDstring> that forces emcopy to consider the given SID as
          the source local SID.

04.14:  - Fixed a bad detection of target server name. When target server name have the same prefix as the
          local server name, the target server name was detected as the same as local server name. This
          prevent emcopy to activate the local group and user migration.
        - Fixed the comparison timestamp processus. Sometime source and target files with the same last
          modification date were detected as not synchronous. This leads emcopy to perform unneeded copy
          when doing the migration in differential mode.
        - Added enhancement of the recovery mechanism in case of brutal abort due to client or application
          crashes or in case of long duration loss of network. Next copy in differential mode will detect
          inconsistent files and redo the copy.

04.15:  - Fixed a copy iconsistency when source reports inconsistency in file size.  Copied file is a non
          empty file without content when source presents a non empty file as empty when the file is opened
          in backup mode.
        - added option /hda <account> option that activates the homedir migration mode. In that mode security
          information for any containers or files are derived from the target dir if it exists or from the
          target parent dir. <account> is considered as the creator owner of any objects.
        - Added option check mode : /cm <md5|bin>
          bin mode forces emcopy to compare source and destination file after the copy. Usage of this option
          reduces the overall performance of the migration. In differential mode, option /d, content of file
          that should be identical (same date same size) are compared.
          md5 mode forces emcopy to compute a md5 sum on the source file during its transfer. After the copy
          a md5 sum is computed on the target file and compared to the md5 sum of the source file.
        - Fixed display of unexpected message in the initialization phase, ERROR (1332), when the target is a
          standalone server.
        - Fixed bad detection of non-existent target share when the target path is given as an UNC path.

04.16:  - Added copy termination when detection of error no space left on device. Migration process is 
          aborted without retries. Not fully transfered files are deleted from the target.
        - Added new option /sidmapfile <filename> used to specify a SID mapping file, Usage of this option is
          allowed only when security information are migrated. Mapping file is made of three differents types
          of line:
             1) Comment line : line started with #
             2) Record type directive line : a line containing only one of following keywords :
                  SID_TO_SID	: means record format is <SID source>:<SID target>
                  HSID_TO_HSID	: means record format is <SID source in hexa>:<SID target in hexa>
                  ISI_RECORD	: means record format is <source server>,{SID|HSID|GROUP|USER}:<value>
                                                        ,<target server>,{SID|HSID|GROUP|USER}:<value>
             3) Mapping lines in the format specified by the last record type directive line.
          There is no limitation of record type directive line.
          A record type directive line can be followed by several records line.
        - Added option /ignoredhsm that forces emcopy to remove any information relative to DHSM and the
          OFFLINE attribute of all files, even for files that aren't managed by DHSM. The removal of the
          OFFLINE attribute affects all migrated files even if, in differential mode, file content is not
          transferred. Files that only exist on target side are not affected by the removal of the OFFLINE
          attribute.

04.16.01 :  - Fixed : emcopy could sometime crash when a log file that can't be open is specified.
            - Fixed : owner or group SID are sometime not well migrated when a sidmapfile is used.

04.16.02 :  - Added : SID revocation.Revoked SID are specified in the SID migration file by the REVOKED 
              keyword in place of a regular target SID in mapping record, ACE relative to revoked SID are
              discarded.

04.17:  - Added : support of file and directory compressed attribute when target volume supports compression.
        - Added : option /compress <ignore|forcefile|forcedir|forceall> which drives emcopy compress policy.
                  Compress policy are applied only when files or directories are created.
                  ignore      : compress attribute is ignored
                  forcefile   : force compress attribute on every files
                  forcedir    : force compress atribute on every directories
                  forceall    : force compress attribute on every files and directories
        - Added : option /trfwindow <size in MB> which specified the maximum size of the sum of all files
                  in tranfer.

04.18:  - Added : option /ondiskfull <abort|retry|wait> which drives emcopy behavior on disk full error.
                  abort         : copy is aborted, process is terminated, this is the default behavior
                  retry         : copy is retried in accordance with retry policies
